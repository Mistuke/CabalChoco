        NOTE: This is a nightly build of the cabal-install tool for Haskell intended for eco-system support.
        It is built from commit %build.commit.hash% from the git repository.
        No support is provided for these builds.  For supported versions see the 'cabal' package.
        ```

        ```
        This cabal package will automatically configure msys2 for use by cabal.  If you already have msys2
        install then nothing else needs to be done. Otherwise msys2 can be installed with `choco install msys2`.
        The package also automatically detects AppVeyor and will configure the msys2 instance that is available by default.

        Lastly in order to facilitate package installations a new CmdLet `mingw64-pkg` is created to make it easier to install
        native dependencies such as `gtk`.
        ```

        The 'cabal.exe' command-line program simplifies the process of managing Haskell software by automating the fetching, configuration, compilation and installation of Haskell libraries and programs.

        Cabal is a system for building and packaging Haskell libraries and programs. It defines a common interface for package authors and distributors to easily build their applications in a portable way. Cabal is part of a larger infrastructure for distributing, organizing, and cataloging Haskell libraries and programs.

Specifically, the Cabal describes what a Haskell package is, how these packages interact with the language, and what Haskell implementations must to do to support packages. The Cabal also specifies some infrastructure (code) that makes it easy for tool authors to build and distribute conforming packages.

The Cabal is only one contribution to the larger goal. In particular, the Cabal says nothing about more global issues such as how authors decide where in the module name space their library should live; how users can find a package they want; how orphan packages find new owners; and so on.</description>
